      <p>A little more about me...</p>
      <p>My name is Clinton and I have been interested in computers and technology for many years. I resolved hardware and software problems for a relatively short period of time, before my career went into a totally different direction as my work experience will show.</p>
      <p>Although I have not yet worked in the tech industry in the capacity I would have liked. I believe through learning code I will be able to make a positive difference in many of the environments that I have been exposed to up until this point.</p>
